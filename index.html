  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Effective date: February 26, 2026</p>

  <p>Hot &amp; Cold Word Guessing ("the App") is a free daily word puzzle game. This policy explains what data the App handles and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device using on-device storage. This data never leaves your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your guesses and scores for each daily puzzle</li>
    <li>Game statistics such as games played, win streaks, and average guesses</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can clear this data at any time by uninstalling the App.</p>

  <h2>Data Sent to Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>When you submit a guess, the guessed word is sent to an AI-powered service (provided by Rork) to compute a semantic similarity score. No personal information is included in these requests — only the guessed word and the target word.</p>

  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. There are no user accounts, no login, and no registration.</p>

  <h2>Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>The App does not include any analytics tracking or advertising.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If this policy is updated, the revised version will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy, you can reach us at <a href="mailto:codroegames@proton.me">codroegames@proton.me</a>.</p>
